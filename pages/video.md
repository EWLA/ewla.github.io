1. Present lyrics, advancing to the next slide as the last word is being sung - give the audience time to react and read the next lyrics.
1. Turn lights off when Lawrence is speaking.
1. After service, start music back up, ensure ST3 is turned up and the shuffle repeat button is blue in ProPresnter.
