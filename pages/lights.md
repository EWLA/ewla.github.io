# Lights

The light board is programmable, defaults will be programmed to keep it simple while running lights each week. There should be no need to reprogram the lights on a weekly basis.

## Full Setup

For a full stage lighting, we have 2 spots in the back of the house, two color side-fill racks, and the fully lit backdrop (9 daisy-chained color spots). All lights will be programmed via the Obey 40 lightboard.

**Note:** Please ensure band doesn't run cables on top of the lights on the back pieces.

### Setup

- The setup team will assemble and roll in the 3 pieces that make the backdrop
  - Plug in the powerstrips between backdrop pieces
  - Plug in DMX cables between the lights on the backdrop pieces
  - Plug in the light controller
  - Make sure all light cans align with the rotation marks
  - Plug in power from stage-right panel to the snake box
- Set up side fill lights
  - Plug in Power
  - Connect DMX control box to lights
  - Angle center 2 light cans onto stage floor
  - Angle outer 2 light cans to ceiling
- Setup back spotlights
  - Run T-Bar through safety cable
  - Mount light on upper, center most post on the outer edge side of the T-Bar
  - Plug in power
  - Plug in the DFI reciever
  - Make sure the light is at about 8-9ft from the floor
  - Point the light at center of stage
  - Close the doors on the light to keep it from hitting the TVs, above the back curtain, and below the knees of a person standing on the front of the stage
