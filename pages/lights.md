# Lights

The light board is programmable, defaults will be programmed to keep it simple while running lights each week. There should be no need to reprogram the lights on a weekly basis.

## Full Setup

For a full stage lighting, we have 2 spots in the back of the house, two color side-fill racks, and the fully lit backdrop (9 daisy-chained color spots). All lights will be programmed via the Obey 40 lightboard.

**Note:** Please ensure band doesn't run cables on top of the lights on the back pieces.

### Setup

- The setup team will assemble and roll in the 3 pieces that make the backdrop
  - Plug in the powerstrips between backdrop pieces ([Image](uploads/images/lights/IMG_0606.JPG))

**Note:** See the manual overrides section for running lights with side-fills only.

### Running

Our current setup shouldn't need any manual color setting, it should all be run off of pre-programmed scenes.

With a full setup, pre-service should use scene 1 - a low side fill and back lights with no spots.

During worship, use scenes 3-8 to match or pair with the side screens.

During announcements and the message, use scene 2 to give more front lighting.

## Manual Overrides

To manually override the side fills:

- Select ONLY fixture 2 ([Image](uploads/images/lights/IMG_0625.JPG))
- Use the first 3 sliders to adjust RGB values of the lights as done on the old board ([Image](uploads/images/lights/IMG_0624.JPG))


To manually override the spots:

- Select ONLY fixture 1 ([Image](uploads/images/lights/IMG_0626.JPG))
- Use only slider 1 to adjust intensity

When a scene is selected, unselecting a fixture will return it to a scene default. What this means is you can only have one override active at a time, generally it will only need to be the side fills.

**WARNING** Do not override the back lights (fixtures 3-11). They are currently not set to take individual programming.
