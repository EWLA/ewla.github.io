# General Setup

Follow these steps for the high level overview on setting up a Sunday service. Please see the individual sections for detailed setup and running of equipment.

**Note:** Setup begins with audio, to allow the band practice time when they are ready. Some of the other setup will occur during ausio setup, but team should focus on the audio first.

1. Lay HDMI and digital snake cable during stage setup. Cables will lay under the panels, not between. 
1. Place snake box behind the state and run power cable to the wall. Plug snake cable into dSnake slot on the snake box.
1. Place the HDMI splitter center behind the stage and plug into second wall socket. 
1. Run spooled power extension cable from power strip in small box to middle of far side of stage (stage right)
1. Run power extender with 4 outlets (long black cable NOT spooled) to middle of stage left from snake box power strip
1. Plug power pods into power extenders at sides of stage. Do not let the band pull them on stage or plug into them. These are for the TV, lights, and speaker on each side
1. Setup speakers, running power and XLR to each. Wrap cables around posts twice. Speakers will be raised to the height where the pin is placed in the fifth hole. XLR connections will go from in A on the speaker to out 1/2 on the snake. Stage right goes in out 1. 
1. Run power from back room to tech table. Place power strip.
1. Setup soundboard by plugging in power, plugging in digital snake into the dSnake port, and plugging in and powering the wireless router. Plug LAN cable into network slot of soundboard and slot 2 of router. 
1. **Be prepared for sound check and band practice!**
1. Turn on computer and plug in power and HDMI cable. Mouse can also be found in the computer box.
1. Setup TVs next to stage. Make sure they are not hanging over the stage. Leave a 3-4 inch gap between speakers and TVs. Plug HDMI into bottom slot of TVs and then into the HDMI splitter behind stage.
1. Place lights middle of stage, running power to hub. Plug in reciever to light bar and run power to the hub as well. Rais lights to roughly 7ft (Top bar should have pin in 7th hole and bottom bar should have one in 5th hole. The lights that sit over the post cover the first hole!).
1. Setup light controls on tech table. Setup spotlight in front of table. Calibrate all lights (turn lights to red and then adjust the lights that everyone gets light on them).
1. Setup media presentation. Lawrence will provide PPT slides for import.
1. Run Sunday service. Record from start to finish.


**Warning!** DO NOT FORGET TO RECORD THE SERVICE TO THE USB DRIVE.
