We are currently using an Allen & Heath Qu-16 Chrome Edition and Allen & Heath AR2412 Digital Snake. We are currently working on getting a solid base of settings, so please refrain from changing many settings.

## Setup

Setup is simple:

1. Place mixer on small folding table in back - plug in power.
1. Place rolling rack behind the center of the stage - plug in power.
1. Plug digital snake into dSnake port on the front of the snake.
1. Run snake cable along with HDMI up to the stage - then underneath the right side of the stage.
1. Plug digital snake into mixer's dSnake port.
1. Plug in all monitors and speakers
1. Power on board (back side - bottom right)
1. Power on snake (back side - bottom right)

**Note:** Leave the coil/reel of the dSnake near the mixer - try not to clutter the space behind the stage.

At this point the connections for the snake are as follows:

* 1-16 on the input (left side) are active input channels
  * 15 is handheld mic (has extra sheath on cord near the XLR plug)
  * 16 is speaker/lapel mic
* The outputs (right side) are:
  * 1 - Left speaker
  * 2 - Right speaker
  * 3 - Front monitor (the XLR from the amp box at the bottom of the rack)
  * 4 - Back monitor (XLR to speaker or IEM box on stage)

## Mixes & Monitors

**Note:** The mixer has motorized faders. Make sure to keep hands/objects off the faders when switching mixes

We have three active mix channels:

* The house - left/right speakers plugged into output channels 1 & 2 of the snake
* The front monitors - plugged into output channel 3 of the snake
* The back monitors - plugged into output channel 4 of the snake

### House Mix

To balance the house mix, press the LR button on the right side of the mixer.

All faders will transition into the current mix for the house. Mute buttons should mute for all mixes.

Make adjustments as normal. Adjustments to gain, pan, and compressor are covered in the [Balancing](pages/audio.md#Balancing) section of the docs.

**Note:** We keep channel 15 and 16 un-muted during service and allow the speaker and MC to mute themselves when they are not talking.

### Monitor Mix

To balance the monitor mix, press the Mix 1 (front monitors) or Mix 2 (back monitor) button on the right side of the mixer.

All faders will transition into the current mix for the selected monitor mix. Mute buttons should mute for all mixes.

Make adjustments (including overall level control with master fader) as the band needs.

## Balancing

## Channel Memory

## Recording

Recording is now done with direct USB recording from the mixer. Lawrence will have a 32GB flash drive for use.

1. Plug in flash drive on upper right corner of mixer
1. From the Home Screen choose `Qu-Drive` ([Image](uploads/images/IMG_0930.JPG))
1. Before service starts, press the record button to prime recording ([Image](uploads/images/IMG_0931.JPG))
1. As service starts, press the play/pause button to begin recording ([Image](uploads/images/IMG_0932.JPG))
1. Press the stop button on the same screen after service is complete to save the file.

**Warning!** Make sure to stop AND follow proper shutdown step before unplugging the flash drive

**Note:** The recordings are stored in the `AHQU/USBREC` folder on the USB drive ([Image](uploads/images/IMG_0937.JPG))


## Playback

## Shutdown

Shutting the mixer down requires a proper power off before pushing the power button.

1. From the home screen, select `Shut Down` ([Image](uploads/images/IMG_0939.JPG))
1. Select `Yes` from the modal dialog ([Image](uploads/images/IMG_0940.JPG))
1. Wait for confirmation screen ([Image](uploads/images/IMG_0941.JPG))
1. Power off board with button on back side of the mixer, bottom right.

## Wireless Mics

Wireless mics should be all setup for use. Check batteries before servicei and change as needed (Handheld will show battery level, lapel will flash the light when low). Do not mess with channel settings, they are currently locked in. If you need to modify channels (or fix them) for any reason, see below:

* Handheld Mic: J9 is the receiver channel, 612 is the handset channel.
* Lapel Mic: This can auto-pair with the reciever. See Lawrence for pairing instructions until we can get them here (need more clarity on steps).
